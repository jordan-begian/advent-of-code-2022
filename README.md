# **advent-of-code-2022**

This Advent of Code I've decided to attempt the puzzles utilizing **JavaScript**. I started my development journey with Java, and have recently shifted to Kotlin as my "daily driver". I've mainly developed backend applications, but have wanted to expand into getting into some frontend. So, I started studying JavaScript via [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1024) to then shift into TypeScript and React.
